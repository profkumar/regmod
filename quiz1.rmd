# Q1


x <- c(0.18, -1.54, 0.42, 0.95)

w <- c(2, 1, 3, 1)

## Plot the variables

plot(x, w, col='red')

# Give the value of μ that minimizes the least squares equation ∑ni=1 [wi*(xi−μ)^2]

## Storing all the four option from the answers for question 1

mu <- c(0.0025, 1.077, 0.1471, 0.300) 

mu

## check one by one, which value of "mu" produces the lowest result

# Notice in the following: lowest values is 3.716543 for 0.1471.. so is the answer

sapply(mu, function(muval) {
  sum(w * (x - muval)^2)  
})



# Q2

# Consider the following data set

x <- c(0.8, 0.47, 0.51, 0.73, 0.36, 0.58, 0.57, 0.85, 0.44, 0.42)

y <- c(1.39, 0.72, 1.55, 0.48, 1.19, -1.59, 1.23, -0.65, 1.49, 0.05)

# Fit the regression through the origin and get the slope treating y as the outcome and x as the regressor. 
# (Hint, do not center the data since we want regression through the origin, not through the means of the data.)

coef(lm(y ~ x - 1))

# To fit a line through the origin, Use -1 in the lm function

plot(x, y, xlim = c(-2, 2), ylim = c(-2, 4))

abline(lm(y ~ x - 1), col = 'red')

abline(h = 0, col = "gray")

abline(v = 0, col = "gray")


# Q3

# Do data(mtcars) from the datasets package and fit the regression model with mpg as the outcome and weight as the predictor. Give the slope coefficient.

# mpg as the outcome and weight as the predictor

data(mtcars)

coef(lm(mtcars$mpg ~ mtcars$wt))

plot(mtcars$wt, mtcars$mpg)

abline(lm(mtcars$mpg ~ mtcars$wt), col = "red")


# Q4

# Consider data with an outcome (Y) and a predictor (X). The standard deviation of the predictor is one half that of the outcome. 
# The correlation between the two variables is .5
# What value would the slope coefficient for the regression model with Y as the outcome and X as the predictor?

# B1 = Cor(Y, X) * Sd(Y) / Sd(X) 

# Sd(X) is one half of Sd(Y) 

# Let Sd(Y) = 1 then Sd(X) = 0.5 and Cor(Y, X) = 0.5  

# Therefore, B1 = (0.5 * 1) / 0.5 = 1



# Q5

# Students were given two hard tests and scores were normalized to have empirical mean 0 and variance 1. 
# The correlation between the scores on the two tests was 0.4
# What would be the expected score on Quiz 2 for a student who had a normalized score of 1.5 on Quiz 1?

# mean 0 and variance 1 will indicate the line goes through the origin (0,0)

# Corr(Y, X) = 0.4 (correlationship of coefficient)

# if x is 1.5 , then y?

1.5 * 0.4

# Q6

# Consider the data given by the following

# x <- c(8.58, 10.46, 9.01, 9.64, 8.86)

# What is the value of the first measurement if x were normalized (to have mean 0 and variance 1)?

# Answer : 

# (actual_value_of__X - mean(x)) / StdDev(x)

x <- c(8.58, 10.46, 9.01, 9.64, 8.86)

norm.x <- (x - mean(x)) / sd(x)

norm.x


# Q7

# Consider the following data set (used above as well). 
# What is the intercept for fitting the model with x as the predictor and y as the outcome?

x <- c(0.8, 0.47, 0.51, 0.73, 0.36, 0.58, 0.57, 0.85, 0.44, 0.42)

y <- c(1.39, 0.72, 1.55, 0.48, 1.19, -1.59, 1.23, -0.65, 1.49, 0.05)

# Let
# x be predictor
# y be outcome

coef(lm(y ~ x))

plot(x, y, xlim = c(-2, 2), ylim = c(-2, 2), col = "blue")

abline(lm(y ~ x), col = "red")

abline(h = 0, col = "green")

abline(v = 0, col = "green")


# And... centerilizing and normalizing

x.1 <- (x - mean(x)) / sd(x)

y.1 <- (y - mean(y)) / sd(y)

plot(x.1, y.1, ylim = c(-2, 2), xlim = c(-2, 2), col = "red")

abline(lm(y.1 ~ x.1), col = "blue")

abline(h = 0, col = "green")

abline(v = 0, col = "green")



# Q8

# You know that both the predictor and response have mean 0. 
# What can be said about the intercept when you fit a linear regression?

# We will solve it using sample data as follows...

x <- c(-4, -2, 2, 4)

mean(x)

y <- c(-6, -1, 3, 4)

mean(y)

coef(lm(y ~ x)) # it must be identically 0


# Q9

# Consider the data given by :

# x <- c(0.8, 0.47, 0.51, 0.73, 0.36, 0.58, 0.57, 0.85, 0.44, 0.42)

# What value minimizes the sum of the squared distances between these points and itself?

x <- c(0.8, 0.47, 0.51, 0.73, 0.36, 0.58, 0.57, 0.85, 0.44, 0.42)

m.x <- c(0.573, 0.8, 0.36, 0.44) # store all the answer choices in a vector

sapply(m.x, function(m.x){
  
  sum((x - m.x)^2)

  })  # so the lowest value is for.. ?? so is the answer... 


# Q10

# Let the slope having fit Y as the outcome and X as the predictor be denoted as β1. 

# Let the slope from fitting X as the outcome and Y as the predictor be denoted as γ1. 

# Suppose that you divide β1 by γ1; in other words consider β1/γ1. 

# What is this ratio always equal to?

# Lets try out...

x <- mtcars$wt

y <- mtcars$mpg

coef(lm(y ~ x))[2] / coef(lm(x ~ y))[2]

# Therefore for the asnwer choice.. Var(Y)/Var(X), we get the answer..

var(y) / var(x)
